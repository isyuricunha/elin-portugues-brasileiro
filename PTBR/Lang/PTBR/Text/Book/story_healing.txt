Shard of Love,Unknown,100

<b>Day of Ruin</b>

On that day, I looked up from the ground as the gods shattered Luci's twin moon, Lacrina.

The gods would not tolerate humanity's arrogance, which had reached even the moon. When the shattered fragments of the moon and the ruins of civilization rained down upon the earth in countless meteors, I believed the world was coming to an end.

Yet, what remains most vivid in my memory is the final voice of the goddess Odina.

"Humankind is still an immature infant. With my life, let me protect them. I entrust Eris to you..."

{p}

She spread her arms wide and, with her profound love, shielded us from the relentless rain of deadly fragments.

When it was all over, and I held her tattered body close, for the first time, I felt hatred for the cruelty of the gods.


<b>Lament</b>

The grief of my mistress, after losing Lady Odina, was immeasurable.

Clinging to her sister's lifeless body, Lady Eris murmured through tears that drenched her trembling voice.

"Sister... why you? Why wasn’t it me?"

{p}

"I should have been the one to sacrifice myself! Unlike you, I’m useless... no one would even mourn me if I died!"

I could find no words to comfort my mistress.

Eventually, when her tears dried, we decided to return to our dimension to protect the final remnants of Lady Odina’s soul.


<b>Despair</b>

Day and night, Lady Eris sought to resurrect her sister, but the warmth of her soul gradually faded from the cold, lifeless body.

"Why... why can’t I save her soul?!"

{p}

Each time her cries echoed from her chamber, it felt as though my heart was being torn apart.

The light in her eyes dimmed, and she sank deeper into despair.


<b>Eris' Decision</b>

One night, my mistress spoke to me.

"Defender, I have made my decision. I will offer this body of mine to my sister. Even if my existence vanishes, it will be worth it if she returns..."

"Lady Eris, please, wait…!"

{p}

My words of protest were in vain. She took her own life.

Even her sacrifice ended in failure. Lady Odina’s soul did not take refuge in her small body.


<b>The Tomb of Souls</b>

Two millennia passed. I spent what felt like an eternity as a guardian of the two sisters' resting place.

Lady Eris' body did not decay, as if she were peacefully asleep.

{p}


<b>Day of Resurrection</b>

One day, Lady Eris' body began to stir faintly. Watching in astonishment, I saw her vessel accept Lady Odina’s soul.

After understanding everything, she opened her eyes and spoke to me.

"Defender, I should not return to life using Eris' body. Within this vessel, a new life is about to emerge."

Lady Odina smiled gently and continued.

"Eris' sacrifice was not in vain. A small, pure soul is being born within her."

{p}

"Let us entrust this body to the life that is about to begin. When she awakens, name her Jure."

I bowed deeply, accepting Lady Odina’s will.


<b>The Innocent Girl</b>

The girl had no memory.

I kept the secrets of her birth and body, but when I told her about her two late elder sisters, she smiled naively and said:

"Defender, my sisters were truly remarkable goddesses. Do you think I can ever become like them?"
{p}

"Lady Jure... you will undoubtedly prove yourself worthy of being the Goddess of Healing."

The innocent girl blushed shyly.


<b>The Three Sisters</b>

Lady Odina’s love, Lady Eris’ sacrifice, and Lady Jure’s birth—all of these wove the threads of the world, and I became the witness to the story of the three sisters.

As long as I live, I will protect Lady Jure with my shield.

One day, Lady Jure will come to realize that within her, the souls of her sisters are also watching over her growth with warm affection.
