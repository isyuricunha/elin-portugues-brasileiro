Adventurer's Weekly #13: Festivals,Head Editor Hans,10,1

<i>Welcome to Adventurer's Weekly, where we cover topics near and dear to your brave hearts.</i>


In this week's issue, we'll be covering several major festivals in North Tyris. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but they are the continent's biggest attractions and worth visiting!

<b>March</b> — Olvina — Moonsong Festival

A festival to remember the goddess Odina, who in her sacrifice set an example for us to follow. Savor the sight of the moons and enjoy fine wine, be it from under the cherry blossoms or in the hot springs.

Olvina is always a breathtaking sight, but the moonsong festival is when the town's beauty is at its peak; if I could only visit one festival, this would be it.

<b>June</b> — Kapul — Festival of the Dead

Many nations have festivals honoring their ancestors, and North Tyris is no exception. Although it's strayed from its more somber roots in recent years, we're still called to remember our mortality, that even the memories of our existence will be forgotten.

But while we're alive, we can enjoy the festival lights, the roar of the sea, and the fragrance of freshly roasted paululu from the burning Yakasha effigies. The festival of the dead is filled with life, and by our remembrance of those who've passed we hold oblivion at bay a little longer.

<b>September</b> — Yowyn — Harvest Festival

It's only natural that a festival honoring Kumiromi would be in Yowyn. Come to the countryside and breathe the crisp autumn air while fireworks blossom in the sky! Sample fresh produce from the year's harvest amidst Yowyn's rustic atmosphere! Marvel at the fine rural craftsmanship that goes into the mushroom and mandrake figurines!

All festival attendees are given a free mushroom hat to wear. It may feel silly, but the harvest festival's easygoing atmosphere is our last chance to have fun before the solemn cold of winter.

<b>December</b> — Noyel — Holy Night Festival

The last festival of the year is the holy night festival, held in honor of the goddess Jure. The trip out to Noyel is hard, but the displays of giant sweets baked specially for the festival are a sight to see! They're offered to Jure at the month's end, so admire them while they're fresh!

The Church of Jure holds a special recruitment drive during the festival: those converting at one of the part-time workers will keep duration of faith, evade divine punishment, <b>and</b> get an authentic Jure body pillow! It's not for me, but there's no better time if you already intend to convert!

<b>Festival Goods</b>

Some attend festivals to browse the rare goods available: items and decorations like ramune, doujins of the gods and themed lanterns are only sold by special vendors at these events.

For those wanting to buy lots of festive goods, I recommend investing at the town's secretary to expand shop inventories and gaining influence to refresh stock. One can also invest in the festival vendors, but since different ones show up every year your investment will be lost once the festival's over!

You can claim festive decorations with furniture tickets, so don't be shy! I myself always bring home the moon every Moonsong Festival for old times' sake.

Festivals are an important part of our history and culture in North Tyris, and it's our sincere hope that adventurers from all over Ylva visit and bring home memories.
