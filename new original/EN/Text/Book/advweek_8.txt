Adventurer's Weekly #8: Shopkeeping,Grandma Shu,10,1

<i>Welcome to Adventurer's Weekly, where I answer you youngins' questions on money.</i>

Today's letter is from a lad in Mysilia askin': <color=blue>"Grandma Shu, the prices shopkeepers are giving me for my loot are terrible! I've considered running my own shop, is it worth it?"</color>

Well, have I got news for you. Shopkeepers suck. Ain't their fault — everyone's gotta make a living — but you're getting only a sliver of what yer things are worth. Don't matter what it is yer sellin', the price is gonna suck.
{p}
Shippin' yer loot's an option, them shippers give you a better price and gold bars to boot. But a shipping box is only so large, and there ain't no hagglin'.

So about yer question, youngin': running yer own shop. It's some work — you gotta set up a storefront, pass a few policies, keep wares in stock. But you'll be callin' the shots, settin' yer prices, and the only limit on yer sales is how many suckers you can hoodwink. Ain't somethin' that everyone cares for, but if you like the idea, Grandma Shu has some advice for you.
{p}
<b>Basics</b>

First things first, ya gotta have land. Find an attractive spot; my own store's on a snowfield with an ancient ruin. Ain't much you <b>have</b> to build — you can just sell things outta a wagon — but some folks like a nice storefront. What you <b>do</b> need is a sales tag: make one at a signboard workshop.

What you do with the tag, youngin', is slap it on yer wares. Open up for business, and people will come in to buy; if you've got a box near a stockpile sign with more of the same stuff, wares get restocked automatically. Taggin' a filled box marks everythin' in it for sale, good if yer the lazy sort like my granddaughter.
{p}
You don't even need to be at the store to run it, folks in North Tyris are honest enough to take what they want and leave the right sum behind. That sorta thing would never work someplace in like Yerl or Eulderna — you have no idea how good you have it here, youngin'.


<b>Making Money</b>

But it don't stop there. You've got a shop, now yer job's to draw in <b>all</b> them customers and wring every miserable oren outta their pockets. That means, youngin', you've got to attack from different angles.

Prices: put up some policies to increase your wares' value, stuff like a general store or restaurant license. Don't like rip-off store myself, feels short-sighted to me.
{p}
Numbers: more suckers, more sales. If you chose a good spot like I did, yer off to a good start. Shell out gold bars for publicity, and do that tourist safety thing so they feel comfortable comin'. And make sure they don't get ate by monsters, dead customers ain't buying nothin'!

Wealth: this here's vital, youngin'. Customers only buy what they can afford; if everythin' on sale's too expensive, nothing gets sold. You want rich folks coming into yer shop, so celebrity's heaven will draw them in. Wealthy folk like tourin' dangerous places, so put yer place off the beaten path.
{p}
But… listen to me. This may sound crazy, youngin', but do it. Start invokin' demons on yer land. That'll make wanderin' monsters stronger, but it'll also draw in wealthier folks. Don't ask me why, it just does. You can set up a border watch if the idea troubles you; it'll keep the worst monsters away without botherin' yer customers none.

That's all the advice Grandma Shu has for you, simple enough that even my cow-shaped granddaughter can understand.
{p}
Actually, one more thing: when your customers buy stuff, they'll want to try out their new purchase on the spot. I ain't questionin' folks who have a taste for acidproof liquid, but I absolutely draw the line at meteorin' my shop. I'm sure you feel the same way, youngin', so have a care as to what you stock on your shelves.
