Adventurer's Weekly #5: Getting Wet,Specwing Correspondent Orryn,10,1

<i>Welcome to Adventurer's Weekly, where we cover topics near and dear to your brave hearts.</i>


Today, we're following mifu adventurer Miyuki into a nefia to learn some tips for novice adventurers on a budget. Can you introduce the things you brought, Miyuki?
<color=brown>
Well… Yuki-chan doesn't have much money, so she brought only simple supplies…
Bandages, kibble, her watering can…
Don't laugh, Mr. Reporter!
Yuki-chan's watering can has saved her many times!

{p}
That's interesting! Isn't a watering can something you use at home? We'll see how it's useful in a nefia!

Miyuki crept into the ruins. A wild fire hound appeared!

Miyuki poured the watering can over herself and approached the fire hound dripping wet.
<color=brown>
Roar~
</color>
A huge burst of flame engulfed Miyuki.

But because she was wet, the fire's damage was weakened and her things weren't burned.

No fireproof blanket!
{p}
With its attacks ineffective, the fire hound was quickly defeated.

Looks like the watering can really helped!

***

Oh no! It's a hot guy!

Miyuki quickly poured water onto the hot guy. The hot guy was drenched.

"Fooooo!"

Being wet, the hot guy couldn't explode and was safely defeated.
{p}
Looks like Miyuki's watering can saved her again!

***

Suddenly, a potion flew out from the darkness!

Miyuki quickly dodged, but couldn't see the monster responsible.

Grabbing her watering can, she sprayed water everywhere.

The entire room became wet with puddles, and the monster stepped in one. Coated with water, the pumpkin couldn't stay invisible.
{p}
Now that she could see her enemy, Miyuki sliced the pumpkin with her copper dagger.
<color=brown>
Hiyaa!
</color>
Wetness made the dagger's lightning damage extra effective!

The pumpkin was electrocuted and defeated!

Wow, that's the third time the watering can saved Miyuki. I should consider how everyday things can be helpful as an adventurer!

<color=brown>
Oh no! Yuki-chan stepped on a trap and was teleported into a wall!
</color>
{p}
<color=brown>Yuki-chan isn't hurt, but she's kind of stuck halfway in this hole…

Could Mr. Reporter please get her watering can from her bag and help her out?

Okay, that's it, but… where are you going, Mr. Reporter?

Wait, that's not —

Kyaa~♡ So slippery~♡
