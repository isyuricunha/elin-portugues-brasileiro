Adventurer's Weekly #12: Runes,Lumiest Correspondent Jaystar,10,1

<i>Welcome to Adventurer's Weekly, where we cover topics near and dear to your brave hearts.</i>


In this issue, we've rented a workshop at the Mage's Guild to have some hands-on experience with runesmithing. Instead of a lengthy explanation, the head editor agreed it's better to illustrate the process with a practical example.

Essentially, runesmithing involves extracting an enchantment from a piece of equipment, then applying it to another. Anyone looking to get the most out of equipment should be interested, but gear-reliant adventurers like warriors stand to benefit the most.

Now, my old pair of miracle-tier silver boots is a bit outdated. I'd like to move its darkness resistance to my new cashmere boots. Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?

<b>Extraction</b>

The first step in runesmithing is to create a suitable rune mold at an accessory table. Two points to note:

* The mold must have a crystal capable of extracting enchantments from the equipment's tier.

* The mold's material must be harder than the equipment's material.

A sun crystal is required for a miracle-tier mold, but since the guild needs them for their latest experiment, there aren't any left; a godly-tier mold made with a magic crystal is fine too. For the mold's main material, steel is harder than silver, and so I've picked out some steel ingots.

Done! We're ready to extract the enchantment.

Extraction is straightforward: focus the rune mold on the equipment and allow the enchantment to flow into it. This destroys the original equipment — now I have a rune of darkness resistance, and my old silver boots are so much alchemical ash.


<b>Infusion</b>

Now to infuse my new boots. My darkness resistance rune can't be applied to my cashmere boots as-is — cashmere's material enchantment of cold resistance prevents resistance runes from being infused. Hence, I've prepared two material hammers, chromite and cashmere.
{p}
First, I change the boots' material to chromite — removing the resistance enchantment — then apply the darkness resistance rune. Once the enchantment is stable, I hammer the chromite boots back into cashmere, resulting in my new boots having both cold and darkness resistance. Now that my new boots are rune-infused, they can no longer accept any further runes.

Such is the basic premise of runesmithing: extract from the old, apply to the new. It sounds simple, but as we've just seen with the conflicting resistance enchantments, it may not be straightforward.

{p}
<b>Nuances</b>

Item enchantments are complex and result in many rules in how runesmithing works. While we don't fully understand why such limitations exist, they must nevertheless be followed.

Extraction:

* Artifact-tier items are too powerful to have runes extracted from or applied to them. Infusion is possible if the extra rune enchantment is present, or if the rune is lawless.

* Special enchantments like speed and life cannot be extracted.

* Material enchantments are extracted at default strength, so equipment enhancement or damage does not matter.
{p}
Infusion:

* Only one rune can be infused per equipment. The extra rune enchantment, such as on rune clothes, increases this limit.

* Resistance runes may not be applied to equipment with resistance enchantments.

* When equipment is infused with an enchantment it already has, its strength is overwritten, not added.

* Enchantments that have equipment type restrictions can only be applied to the same equipment types.

* Lawless runes do not count towards the rune limit.

{p}
Every adventurer should consider runesmithing, as it allows us to combine the best aspects of our equipment and cover weaknesses, and is also a means of salvaging nefia loot.
