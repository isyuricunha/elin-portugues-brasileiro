<i>Welcome to Adventurer's Weekly, where we cover topics near and dear to your brave hearts. </i>


This week's issue is sponsored by the Palmian city guard.

Dark!

Mysterious!

Alluring!

Yes, succubi exist. However, their abilities are greatly exaggerated by adventurers bragging of encounters with these "moonlit kin", and it falls to our magazine to correct these misconceptions.

Succubi may look no different from you and me, but when darkness falls they go nightcrawling in search of sleeping victims and mischief!

That's the only thing the rumors get right.

<b>Abilities</b>

The succubus' ability to create dream larvae is well-documented: these insects may be slipped into food to drug a victim into liking the succubus akin to a love potion. They may also be hidden in a victim's inventory to compel seeking out the succubus for mischief when the succubus sleeps.

Ironically, young succubi often overextend themselves with too many victims, leading to death by exhaustion. Conversely, experienced succubi bypass the need for sleeping victims and directly employ dream larvae in their mischief against those they've restrained.

Succubi have another notable trait: adventurers agree that succubi grow from mischief, but not how, leading to much wild speculation. After consulting the city guard and Mages' Guild, our magazine can confirm that tales of level drain and such are nothing more than adventurers' erotic fantasies.

What <b>does</b> happen during mischief is that the succubus compares its base attributes' against its victim's; the highest base attribute of the victim above that of the succubus' is what it gains potential in. The stamina cost is based on the difference of both parties' maximum endurance.
{p}
In short, the stronger the victim, the more the succubus benefits, but also tires more quickly; succubi have to seek out ever-stronger victims to continue honing their attributes and gain no benefit from weaker victims.

That's all. Contrary to popular belief, succubi do not gain extra attribute experience over what mischief would normally grant!

A final note: while succubi are immune to diseases from mischief, they can spread them, so be careful!

<b>Protection</b>

Moonlit kin are a societal menace: they like large cities, where they blend in amongst citizens and seek victims. Be it breaking into homes, dominating others' wills, or carelessly spreading disease, they refuse to be reasoned with and shamelessly persist in their crimes. Here are some helpful tips to protect yourself:

*Do not accept food from strangers. This is important!

*Diamond equipment offers some protection against mischief.

*Succubi favor nun outfits as disguises, so banning the entry of mothers may help.

*Place a strange pillow in your bedroom — a traditional runic ward against nightcrawling succubi. Only works if it's the right way up.

If you encounter succubus activity or know someone who may have been dominated with dream larvae, please make a report with the city guard.

While many consider the pranks of moonlit kin harmless and may even seek them out for pleasurable activities, their wanton behavior is a threat to public health and order.
