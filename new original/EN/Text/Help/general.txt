・ Your maximum stamina increases as your skills develop. Skills can be increased even by simply walking around so try visiting various places in Tyris.

・ You can recruit people in towns to your home by increasing their affinity. Try giving them something they might like.

・ When you die, you lose some of your money and portions of your abilities are also reduced. However, the death penalty will not occur for the first 90 days of the game so don't be afraid to die.

・ The chance of ambush is reduced on the roads in the global map. The further you stray from the roads and your home, the higher the level of local map content becomes.

・ If you put your items in the delivery boxes located around the town, they will be delivered to your home.

・ If your initial pet dies, you can have it resurrected for free by talking to Fiama.

・ Wild animals have a high chance of dropping meat and materials.

$FAQ
{Q|I can't pick up items!}
{A|If you are holding an item such as an axe, you won't be able to pick up items from the ground. Press the Q key or scroll the mouse wheel to make sure your hands are empty.}
{Q|My item has disappeared!}
{A|It’s common for items to get misplaced on the second page of the hotbar. Try pressing the CTRL key to switch hotbar pages and check again. You can also press CTRL+F to search for items in your inventory or on the map.}
{A|When placing furniture or similar items, accidentally moving the mouse wheel can cause items to be placed in the air without you noticing. Also, if they’re hidden behind obstacles and hard to spot, pressing SHIFT+ALT will flatten the map’s terrain, making them easier to find.}
{Q|My companion is gone!}
{A|When companions or residents die, they are sent to the subspace. You can talk to the bartender to bring them back, or if it’s a pet given to you by Fiama, talk to Fiama. Companions will also automatically revive at their home after some time passes, so check your base’s resident board.}
{A|The Hearth Stone has a convenient feature where you can keep companions on standby, so it’s possible you may have accidentally transferred your companion there. Select “Recall” from the Hearth Stone to check which companions are waiting.}
{Q|My companion's equipment is missing!}
{A|The most common reason for this is that your companion decided they didn't need the item and placed it in one of the shared containers at your base. Sometimes other residents might have taken it as well.}
{A|Stay calm and try using the CTRL+F search function. You can search for items in residents' inventories and containers, too.}
{Q|My delivery/tax bill hasn’t arrived!}
{A|When using a delivery box in town, the delivery will arrive at the next base you visit. If you have multiple bases, the package may have been sent to another base. Packages arrive at 6 AM in the morning.}
{Q|I can’t place furniture!}
{A|Some furniture, such as musical instruments, are treated as tools when held and cannot be placed on the ground directly. To place them, middle-click on the item in your backpack to bring up the action menu and select “Grab as Furniture” to place it on the ground.}
{Q|I die too quickly!}
{A|If you’re new to this world, a combination like the Hillfolk race and Warrior class will give you higher health and more stability. Increasing your PV(Protection Value) will also reduce the damage you take from enemy attacks and help you survive longer. Try crafting to fill all your equipment slots as soon as possible. Throwing stones or attacking from a distance is another good strategy.}
{Q|There’s too much I don’t understand!}
{A|Following the traditions of classic roguelikes, this game is designed to be deliberately unkind. In fact, it’s perfectly normal to feel like there’s too much you don’t understand!}
