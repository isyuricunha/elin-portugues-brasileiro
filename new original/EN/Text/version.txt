* Companions fishing together will no longer pick up items other than fish if they are too heavy.
* When using the Gun Barrel Processor or Grindstone, companions’ inventories can now also be selected.

* Status icon positions and speech bubble positions are now adjusted per character. Also adjusted status icon positions for Triceratops, Mechanical Shark, and others.

* When affected by status ailments, blessings, curses, etc., the tooltip shown on mouse-over of the icon will now clearly display the category of that status.
* When companions being ridden or parasitized enter forced death processing due to non-standard damage (self-destruction, hatching, etc.), they will now have their HP reduced to 0 and become unconscious.
* Adjusted the activation conditions for Beheading. Against bosses and uniques, the HP threshold for activation is now lower.
* Enhanced the effect of the magic “Flare”.

* Adjusted the “Beast of Possibility” feat on NPC “Demilich” from -2 to -1.
* Adjusted the speed bonus of NPC “Starfish” from -100 to -70.
* Adjusted NPCs “Giant Fish”, “Electric Eel”, “Shark”, “Mechanical Shark”, and “Younger Sister Shark”, mainly increasing HP for large fish-type NPCs (they were weaker than they looked).
