Dear Friend,,0
{center}

Avoid the sun...
The shadow of roof and tree shields you from its burning wrath...

When the road stretches far, take the form of a bat...
This gift already stirs in your blood...

Mortal food cannot sustain you...
Seek blood — your true sustenance...

Forget not your hunger...
Hunger is the compass that leads you...

Heed your desire...
The night is yours to claim...
