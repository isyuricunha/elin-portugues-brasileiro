With Sincere Gratitude,Loytel,0

Dear #pc,

As the late autumn deepens, I trust this letter finds you in ever sound health and good spirits.

I remain deeply grateful for your continued assistance in the settlement of what was, at the outset, my own personal financial burden. Your generosity has been a debt of a different kind—one not easily repaid.

Though we have grown personally acquainted, as the saying goes, even friendship must observe its proper courtesies. Thus, I wished to take this occasion to formally convey my gratitude, and have enclosed a bottle of Crim Ale from Lumiest.

I would be most honored if it should suit your taste.

Wishing you continued health and success in all your endeavors.

Sincerely yours,
Loytel
Former Frontier Inspector of Mysilia
