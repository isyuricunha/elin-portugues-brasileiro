Journal of Lutz Volume 6,Lutz the Former Hero,0

Tools like pickaxes have something called hardness. A pickaxe made from a tough material can crush even iron ore, but with a wooden pickaxe, unless you're incredibly skilled at mining, you wonâ€™t even scratch the surface of ordinary stones.

It's time to return to my forest base. If I use that black basalt stone I've been saving for moments like this, I should be able to make a pickaxe that can dig through that rock salt.
