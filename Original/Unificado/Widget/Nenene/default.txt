You may have heard of this story before...
There was once a prince
Who had his shape changed into
That of an ugly beast by a witch
Desparing of his bloodcurdling appearince
He hid himself in a forest far from his kingdom
One day
A woman rushed into his hut
And passed out
Having been badly wounded by a pack of wolves
He treated her with the knowledge
And fear that his ugly body might scare her
This fear turned into reality soon enough
For she cried out as she woke up
However, as days passed by
And she regained her health
The woman had come to recognize the kindness
And generosity that was within the heart of this beast 
She decided to live with him
They surmounted various difficulties throughout their lives
And the story comes to an end
When the curse set upon the prince finally breaks
And the beast returned to his former shape
That of a flawlessly handsome prince 
The two of them got along very well from that time on
A happy ending... 
Although just an ordinary story
Don't you agree?
The elders of Vindale used to tell me this kind of story
But I never liked this one
Perhaps it is because I felt like the beast that she loved
Despite the fact that his ugliness
Had been left behind somewhere
You know the fairy tale
Where a wicked witch transforms a dashing prince into an monster?
(The stunning beauty of Elea's face halts your step a moment)
The world is thrown into bedlam and chaos
We must remain strong in the face of it
The man we saw in Vernis he just might be...
Someone mutters in mysterious ancient language
Eleas is already being regarded as a heretic 
Your lofty dignity isn't helping this
Do we really have to fight?
Sorry I don't have time for this
(The Elean little girl has an angry look in her beautiful cold eyes)
A-ah...
I failed my task...
this world....this world will....
Sorry...
