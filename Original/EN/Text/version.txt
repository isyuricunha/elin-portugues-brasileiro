{topic, Elin Update Information}
■ 6/11 2025 EA 23.152 Stable Patch 1
(Translated by ChatGPT)

[Additions and Changes]
* Replaced mistakenly included sponge block with a mysterious block
* Adjusted genetic drug prices
* (English version) Renamed Harimaguro to pintuna (since both tuna and Harimaguro were named tuna)

[Fixes]
* Corrected some English translations
* Other minor fixes and adjustments

[Notes]
* If no major issues are found, plan to resume Nightly updates. From late June to July, there will be some renovation work in my aging room, so updates might be a bit slower than usual.

■ 6/10 2025 EA 23.152 Stable

After the stable version update, some mods may stop working or behave strangely. If anything unusual happens, please try disabling mods once and check again.  

[Highlights]

* Added feat “Lord of the Pack,” assigned to some NPCs.
* Added hair-related mutations.
* Added rare enchantment “shockwave immunity” to leg equipment random enchants.
* Added status “Berserk.”
* Added new material “whipped cream” (because of a craving to jump into a sea of whipped cream).
* Added new crop “Cabocchi.”
* Added second growth stage graphics for cabocchi, radish, and tomato crops (previously indistinguishable from third stage).
* Added two new coral variations and replaced some existing coral graphics.
* Added coral reef map objects, now spawning in underwater Nefia.
* Added red algae floor for underwater Nefia.

* Added red books: “First Cooking,” “Let’s Go Fishing!”, and “Ranch Story.”
* Added two bunny boy portraits (Thanks minagi!).
* Added two new monsters.

[New Items and Recipes]
* Added “what once was.”
* Added naginata.

* Added foreign doll.
* Added hair tonic recipe to the alchemy table.
* Added egg-laying medicine recipe to the alchemy table.
* Added pulpit recipe to the crafting table.
* Added two seed recipes to the millstone.
* Added coral reef recipe and adjusted material requirements.

* Added rare drop to polar bears.
* Added rare drops to Tyrannosaurus and Dodorex.
* Added rare drop to Triceratops.

* Added covered well graphic variant.

[Alchemy Potion Changes]
* Alchemy potions now gain strengthened levels based on alchemy skill (capped by potion quality), with effects increasing according to strength level.
* Strength boost from alchemy potions now individually set by potion type (recovery, ability restoration, etc.).
* Temporary attribute boosts/weaknesses from potions no longer have random variance.
* Temporary attribute boosts/weaknesses cannot stack.
* Blessed recovery potions now consistently boost all related attributes, no longer random.
* Added “temporary attribute cap increase” to the effect of the “Mead Blood” feat.
* (Explanation of temporary attribute boost) If a potion boosts strength by 50 for a character with 100 base strength, the cap (25% of base = 25) limits it to +25. For 1000 base strength, the cap is 250, so the potion fully boosts by 50, but never more.

[Additions and Changes]

* Teleporters with IDs no longer stack in the inventory.

* Large instruments (piano, harpsichord, etc.) no longer block sight.
* Max carry weight will not fall below 1s.
* Goddess’s drool wish power boost increased fivefold.
* Added “not for sale” tag to wish wands.

* Added “no duplication” effect to item traits 【Aphrodisiac】, 【Insect】, and 【Divine Flesh】.
* Updated snow graphic.
* Updated Chinese translation.

[Fixes]
* Fixed a bug where rounding error in ether disease accumulation caused incorrect values.
* Fixed wish spellbooks not generating (probably).
* Fixed negotiation skill affecting wish item values.
* Fixed overlapping negative effects reversing the speed law in the speed calculation formula.

[Notes]
* Changes in character sprite files may cause glitches with modded character images.
* “What once was” represents residue, not meat—dropped by machines and other non-meat races.
* Seed improvement via millstone and gene extraction may involve additional crafting steps in the future (e.g., using fertilized eggs and gene drugs in a gene extractor).
* Gene drugs currently only available via wishes. Items like gene drugs and runes are being added early as part of future craftable or quest rewards, balanced for the current environment.
* Large-scale farming, bubble factories, and dairy are still pending balance adjustments, but current mechanics will mostly remain as world laws.
* All newly added red books were provided by the Elin community. Thank you for your support!
* The pulpit should eventually allow creating classrooms at home.
* (Trivia) Treasure chests from Fiama occasionally shiver for a few days after being obtained.
