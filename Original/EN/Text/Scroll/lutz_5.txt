Journal of Lutz Volume 5,Lutz the Former Hero,0

Sometimes, I wonder if these letters will ever reach someone’s hands, or if they’ll just be left to wither away, unknown and forgotten.

Either way, it’s fine. It doesn’t really matter what I leave behind in this world, or who might find it, or what they might think.
