A Farewell Gift,Ashland,0

It’s been a while, hasn’t it, #pc? How have you been?

Fiama and I are currently staying at Willow Keep where Lord Cetrus reigns. Our departure was a bit rushed, and we didn’t have time to properly say goodbye, but let me take this opportunity to express my gratitude for all the help and information you provided.

By the way, isn't your sturdy chest getting a bit cramped with all the items and crafting resources you’ve gathered on your explorations?

I happened to come across something good at Willow Keep, so I’m sending it your way. It’s called a “Storage Chest” — a rather plain name, but it’s a masterpiece crafted by the master artisans of the Hillfolk. I hope it proves useful in your future adventures.

P.S.
It seems this chest can be further upgraded. If you’re lucky enough to meet a Hillfolk craftsman on your journey, be sure to ask them about it.
