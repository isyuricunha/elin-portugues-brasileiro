Journal of Lutz Volume 3,Lutz the Former Hero,0

The summer sun bakes the sandy beach, and Mii-Chan and the Ris-Chan are napping quietly beside me. I’m swaying in a hammock, a glass of Palulu juice in hand.

It’s perfect. I think coming here was the right choice. Finding this place after leaving the forest and venturing a little farther—it must have been a twist of fate.

Next time, I’ll tell you more about this beach.
