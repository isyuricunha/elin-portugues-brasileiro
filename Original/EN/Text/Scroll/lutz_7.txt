Journal of Lutz Volume 7,Lutz the Former Hero,0

While exploring the beach, I found an ancient machine buried in the sand. A rare device that, when you insert a small box called a ""<color=green>cassette</color>,"" plays a strange tune. Mii-Chan, startled at first, now listens quietly.

I've also crafted a barbecue set. This beach has become our second base. Sitting by the fire, listening to ancient music, I wished for time to stop, if only for a moment. But a restless feeling deep inside wonâ€™t allow it. I need to find the promised land. Where could it be?
