The Tale of Wind,Unknown,100

Once upon a time, there lived a nameless little spirit who roamed the forest with boundless freedom. She felt an invisible bond with the wind, which often carried her voice, conveying her feelings to the forest and its inhabitants. No matter where she went, the wind never abandoned her, always dancing around her as if to envelop her in its embrace.

Yet, on a day when the wind was weak, she felt a deep loneliness. She encountered a traveler at the edge of the forest and spoke with him. When he asked for her name, she replied indifferently, "Call me what you wish." The traveler named her "Aura," and thus, it became her name.

The moment the traveler uttered her name, she felt the sound of the wind halt, and the entire forest fell into silence. From then on, the wind ceased to dance around her.

Aura accompanied the traveler and lived in his homeland. Although he cherished her, she always felt sorrow as if her freedom had been taken away. No matter how much she spoke to the wind, it no longer replied, and Aura was struck by a deep disappointment.

One day, she found a nest of a little bird. In it, a fledgling, having lost its parent, was desperately flapping its wings trying to fly. Watching the fledgling fail and fall to the ground, Aura deeply pondered. The wind was a symbol of freedom and at the same time, it was something that supported life.

Just as the fledgling was about to give up, she discarded the name given by the traveler and called out to the wind.

"Wind, call my name. It is Lulwy, not Aura. Know me by this name and dance with me again."

And then, the wind returned to dance around her once more.

As Lulwy felt a newfound strength surge through her, she gently lifted the fledgling into the sky, and the wind began to play a song. It was a melody that embraced sadness and joy, life and death, celebrating Lulwy's freedom and her renewed bond with the wind.
