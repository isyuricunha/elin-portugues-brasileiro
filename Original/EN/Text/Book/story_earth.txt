The Forgotten Melody,Unknown,100

Long, long ago, deep beneath the earth, a god named Opatos was born.

He was the first god to appear in the land of Yrva, and he felt a deep loneliness in the emptiness where no one else existed. For countless ages, Opatos wandered alone, wondering where he had come from and why he was here.

One day, however, a great war broke out among the gods.

By throwing himself into the chaos of battle, Opatos found a way to forget his solitude. Amid the thrill of combat and the cries of destruction, his mind quieted, and he felt a fleeting sense of fulfillment.

Yet, buried deep within his heart, there remained something he could never forget.

It was a lullaby he had once heard in the depths of the earth—a melody so beautiful it seemed as though the earth itself was singing to him. That melody soothed Opatos’s loneliness and lingered in his memories.

Often, he would retreat to the depths of the earth to fall into a deep slumber, hoping to hear that tune once more in his dreams.

One day, while listening to a playful melody carried by the wind—a song spun by the whimsical Lulwy—Opatos suddenly recalled the lullaby.

Overcome with joy, he struck the earth with his mighty fist. The symphony of the gods resonated through the earth and sky, touching the hearts of all living beings under the stars.

Was that melody the very same lullaby he had heard long ago? And who had sung it to Opatos and Lulwy in the first place? No one knows the answer.

But the melody has transcended the ages, passed down through the hands of bards, who continue to sing it even to this day.
