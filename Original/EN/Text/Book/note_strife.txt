Strange Letter of Challenge,Man with a scar,0

Hey there, adventurer. Glad you’re taking the time to read this.

Let me ask you something—have you ever faced a god?


Down southeast of North Tyris, there’s a place where the winds rest. That’s where you might run into a god who once defied the heavens, failed, and got sealed away.

Sure, this god is far from his prime, but he's no easy opponent. Go in swinging without being ready, and you’ll just get crushed. No fun in a one-sided massacre, is there? So, make sure you’re well prepared. When you’ve fought far and wide, and you’re thinking, “There’s no one left in this world who can take me on,” that’s when you're ready to take on this challenge.

Even gods bleed if you cut deep enough. You're free to go head-on with your honed skills, or maybe you’ll play some tricks. You may lose once, but defeat isn't the end if you keep coming back. As long as you continue to evolve, you’ll win eventually. Just don’t let up—give it everything you’ve got and keep pushing forward.

And don’t sweat it about breaking his seal. He’s not going anywhere, and he isn't going to turn into a world-ending threat. His seal and the will of those who had their swords taken from him will be keeping him in his place. You have my word—I’ll be watching.

If you manage to take down that arrogant ancient god who looks down on mortals, that'll be quite the saga. Interested now?

I’m counting on you to achieve something incredible—something that even surpasses the divine. I’ll be looking forward to it!

P.S. Oh, and if you manage to win but still want more, try offering the god's heart at the Altar of Chaos. You just might get what you want.
