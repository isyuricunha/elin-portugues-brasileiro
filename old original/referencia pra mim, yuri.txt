Bro, I can help you with information on how to make updating your translation mod more convenient.

You can use xlcompare dot com to compare xlsx files. Use this site only to see what has changed, do not use it to edit the files themselves.

To search for text in translation files, you can use searcher.exe (first link in Google from sourceforge).

To understand which files have been updated in the new version, rename the update.txt file to update23200, then when a new "stable" version of the game is released, a new file will appear in the same place. Then, you just need to compare the old update file with the new one.
