The Little Black Cat Beneath the Great Tree,Unknown,100

- Once upon a time, before Kumiromi became a god, he wandered the universe as a spore-like being, drawn to the brilliance of life.

When he descended upon the land of Ylva, he planted himself deeply into the earth, and over countless years, he transformed into a magnificent tree.


- Time passed, and in the heavens, a tiny black kitten was born. Her name was Ehekatl. She was part of the family of the cat gods, but her fate was a tragic one.

Her jealous elder sister, Fuhetotl, poisoned their mother, who was carrying Ehekatl in her womb.

{p}

When Ehekatl was born, her body was incomplete, her fur as black as night—a color many saw as a symbol of ill fortune.

Worse still, her mother lost her life giving birth to her. Labeled "Ehekatl of Misfortune," the tiny kitten was cast down to the earth, abandoned and alone.


- Little Ehekatl wandered the world.

She longed to play with the children of men, but her fragile body would break apart whenever she tried, scaring them away.

No matter where she went, she was met with fear and rejection, and soon, she was utterly alone.


{p}

- One day, exhausted from her endless wandering, Ehekatl found herself in a forest.

She stumbled upon a great tree, and at its base, she curled up, her tiny body trembling with sadness, and fell asleep in tears.

But then, she felt a presence. Opening her eyes, she saw a beautiful boy standing before her.

The boy smiled gently and lifted Ehekatl into his arms. She tried to run away, frightened, but his embrace was warm and comforting, holding her securely.

{p}

As she had feared, her frail body broke apart, spilling its insides.

"I’ll be rejected again…" she thought as she looked up at the boy. But to her surprise, he still wore the same kind, gentle smile.

Relieved, Ehekatl drifted into the most peaceful sleep she’d had in ages.


- When she awoke, the boy was gone.

But from that day onward, the great tree became Ehekatl’s favorite place. The boy would always appear from the shadow of the tree, gently picking her up with the same warmth as before.

{p}

Ehekatl visited the tree again and again, waiting for him. Sometimes, she would try to take on the form of a little girl, hoping to please him more, though she often failed and broke her body once more.

Still, her time with the boy was the happiest she had ever known.


- However, this era came to be known in later years as the "Age of War," a time of great strife and terror.

As the shadows of war crept into the forest, the trees around the great one burned, and calamity followed calamity. Ehekatl, seeing the destruction, began to blame herself, convinced that her presence was a source of misfortune.

{p}

- One day, beneath the great tree, she confessed her sorrowful past to the boy.

In response, he spoke gently to her:

"My dear Ehekatl, it’s your gift of fortune that has kept this tree safe from the war."

The boy revealed that the great tree was, in fact, his true form. He then gave her a new name: "Ehekatl ofLuck."

In that moment, the two of them were bound by a sacred bond.

{p}

- Together, Kumiromi and Ehekatl worked hand in hand, creating a sanctuary of peace where all life could flourish, even in the midst of the Age of War.

It was then that Ehekatl finally understood—she was not "Ehekatl of Misfortune" but truly "Ehekatl of Luck."


- The End.
