My Aunt,A Cute Fox,50

Auntie has been with me since I was little, I'm her favorite niece. Father loves me and my siblings, but he didn't know anything about raising children, so Auntie came over and helped him until he learned how and could manage.

Now that I'm older, I'm her personal servant; she even gave me nice clothes to wear when I'm waiting on her.

They're a little weird, but since it's for her I'm okay with it.

Auntie's really good with a longsword. She says she learned swordsmanship from a human long ago, and refined that into her own style during a terrible war.
{p}

When I ask her about the war, though, she gets really angry and sad.

Sometimes she's going through the forms in earnest, sometimes she's just dancing, but it's hard to tell which is which. She also invites her friends over to spar, and it's really scary but cool when they get excited.

I want to learn from her someday.

Auntie likes plain rice cake. The modest sweetness is appropriate for a refined lady, and its chewiness means you can eat a little for a long time. Father always has a lot of rice, so she makes me pound it until my shoulders hurt.

"It's because you're small that your strength is concentrated," she says.

What her favorite really is, though, are sweets made with red bean. She finds the flavor really rich and acts like a child when she receives any, so Father always teases her about it.

Sometimes she tries to have some when she thinks I'm not looking, but I know.

We're going down to the lower world today. Auntie has made lots of sweets, and we're going to open our stall at the usual place by the mountain pass and sell them to mortal children. The special this time is dumplings, and my fingers still ache.

When we hide our ears and tails, we look like mother and daughter; every time I tell Auntie that, she blushes and gets all embarrassed. But it's true, the two of us sell a lot of sweets this way. I'm cute and small, while Auntie is mature in both appearance and speech. We're the perfect duo.

Even so, I wish I could take after her like Big Sis does… I want a bigger chest…

Human children really like Auntie, and she likes them just as much. I think she would really like to have lots of babies to call her own, but she just hasn't met the right person yet. She's usually so serene and proper, but even the slightest hint of romance has her all embarrassed; Auntie's really immature when it comes to matters of love, I'll have to play matchmaker if she's to get anywhere before the end of this age.

Until then, she's going to treat everyone's child as her own…

The best part of being Auntie's servant is the headpats. When she rewards me like this, my worries disappear and it feels like everything's going to be all right.

"You've served me so well."

When she says those words with a smile and her fingers in my hair, I can believe it. So long as I'm at Auntie's side, I'm not afraid of tomorrow.
