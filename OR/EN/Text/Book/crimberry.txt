Crimberry Addiction and You

Every year more and more people are becoming addicted to the seemingly harmless Crimberry.

Known by an ancient Nefian dialect as Kur-amu-beri, which should just go to show its long and sordid history with our land and peoples, the Crimberry is a strong hallucinogen with many different applications.

Simply eating a berry can cause the following symptoms in 15 to 60 mins:

- Hallucinations

- Impairment like Drunkenness

- Raving like a loon

- Fever-like motor-control failure.

Crimberry's are highly addictive, and should the addict fail to get his next "Crim", he will either turn to other narcotics, or become a threat to our community.

And of course, no one thinks of the poor children who get involved in our seemingly "adult" activities. They've even created a new way to "enjoy" the devilish berries;

They copy the wild yeeks and dry them then shove the dried berry up their nose. This "snorting" of Crimberries will lead to the proliferation of excess agression, and will lead more desparate individuals to become known as "adventurers" commiting insane deeds to get their next fix.

While some of the older, long haired Wizards demand that Crimberries remain legalized, if only for their sacred "rituals", this must stop!
