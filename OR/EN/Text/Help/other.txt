{topic, Numbering and the artists}
The paintings in the art collection are numbered according to categories. It might be interesting to speculate how they are numbered from the collected paintings. Works from 0 to 899 are by an artist known as NZ, while those from 900 to 999 are by an artist named MT.

{topic, Prohibitions, etc.}
Unauthorized distribution of images from the art book, as well as their use for AI training or AI editing purposes, is prohibited.
