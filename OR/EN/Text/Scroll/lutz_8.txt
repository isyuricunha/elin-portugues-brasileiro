Journal of Lutz Volume 8,Lutz the Former Hero,0

I wonder if anyone is reading my letters. If "you" are reading this, what could be the reason? Just passing time? Or did you pick it up hoping to find something?

If you hold my diaries dear, do me a favor and throw them away. No, thereâ€™s an even better way.

When you need to get rid of accumulated trashes or junks, a <color=green>hammer</color> is best. By smashing them to pieces, you can turn them into something new. So, pick up a <color=green>hammer</color> and break my diaries. Smash them with all your strength. That way, these pages might carry just a bit more meaning.
