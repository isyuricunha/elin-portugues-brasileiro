{topic,Restoring Backup}
A backup is automatically created each time the game version is updated. Additionally, you can manually back up your save data from the gameâ€™s load screen.

When you select "Restore" on the load screen, a list of backed-up worlds will be displayed. Please note that if you load a backed-up world and save within the game, the current world will be overwritten instead of the backup.
