Journal of Lutz Volume 1,Lutz the Former Hero,0

Maybe that title of “former hero” was just a joke all along. Everything I believed in was built on a lie. When I heard the sound of it all collapsing, I thought about leaving this world behind.

But then, for some reason, I was struck by the round, innocent eyes of Mii-Chan, the gluttonous seal. In them, I saw a small glimpse of hope for a paradise. And so, I decided to aim for the promised land, just the two of us.

Now, I live off the land in a remote forest, preparing for the journey ahead.

Who this letter, written in a sleepless night, will reach—I’m looking forward to finding out.
